                                <li><p><strong>orders:</strong> This file contains all the orders made by different users. From below analysis, we can conclude following:</p>
                                <ul>
                                <li>There are total 3421083 orders made by total 206209 users.</li>
                                <li>There are three sets of orders: Prior, Train and Test. The distributions of orders in Train and Test sets are similar whereas the distribution of orders in Prior set is different.</li>
                                <li>The total orders per customer ranges from 0 to 100.</li>
                                <li>Based on the plot of &#39;Orders VS Day of Week&#39; we can map 0 and 1 as Saturday and Sunday respectively based on the assumption that most of the people buy groceries on weekends.</li>
                                <li>Majority of the orders are made during the day time.  </li>
                                <li>Customers order once in a week which is supported by peaks at 7, 14, 21 and 30 in &#39;Orders VS Days since prior order&#39; graph.</li>
                                <li>Based on the heatmap between &#39;Day of Week&#39; and &#39;Hour of Day,&#39; we can say that Saturday afternoons and Sunday mornings are prime time for orders.</li>

                                <p>For the analysis I combined all of the separate data files into one single dataframe and to fit the dataframe in my memory I reduced its size to 50% (4.1 GB to 2.0 GB) by type conversion and without loosing any information.</p>

                                <li>As we can see in below plot that the reorder percentage of day-to-day food items is high and for other products such as vitamins, first-aids, beauty products, etc. reorder percentage is low. This is true as we buy only groceries regularly and do not buy those items in every order.</li>

                                - The below plot shows popular departments. The store layout should be in a way that popular departments are very near to each other.

If we are interested in shelf space optimization, we should have only these 10000 products. Here, I assume that the profit from remaining 39688 products are not significant high. If we had prices of these products, we could have considered the products having high revenue, high reorder percentage and high total product sale.</li>

                                <p>Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics so companies can market to each group effectively and appropriately. We can perform segmentation using the data of which products users buy. Since there are thousonds of products and also thousands of customers, I utilized aisles which represent categories of products. </p>
                                <p>I then performed Principal component analysis to reduce dimensions as KMeans does not produce good results on higher dimensions. Using 10 principal components I carried out KMeans clustering. I chose optimal number of clusters as 5 using Elbow method shown below.</p>
                                <p align="center">

                                <li>Cluster 1 results into 5428 consumers having a very strong preference for water seltzer sparkling water aisle.</li>
                                <li>Cluster 2 results into 55784 consumers who mostly order fresh vegetables followed by fruits.</li>

                                <p>Market Basket Analysis is a modelling technique based upon the theory that if you buy a certain group of items, you are more or less likely to buy another group of items. Market basket analysis may provide the retailer with information to understand the purchase behavior of a buyer. This information can then be used for purposes of cross-selling and up-selling, in addition to influencing sales promotions, loyalty programs, store design, and discount plans.</p>
                                <p>Market basket analysis scrutinizes the products customers tend to buy together, and uses the information to decide which products should be cross-sold or promoted together. The term arises from the shopping carts supermarket shoppers fill up during a shopping trip.</p>
                                <p>Association Rule Mining is used when we want to find an association between different objects in a set, find frequent patterns in a transaction database, relational databases or any other information repository.</p>
                                <p>The most common approach to find these patterns is Market Basket Analysis, which is a key technique used by large retailers like Amazon, Flipkart, etc to analyze customer buying habits by finding associations between the different items that customers place in their “shopping baskets”. The discovery of these associations can help retailers develop marketing strategies by gaining insight into which items are frequently purchased together by customers. The strategies may include:</p>

                                <li>Changing the store layout according to trends</li>
                                <li>Customers behavior analysis</li>

                                <p><strong>Support</strong> : Its the default popularity of an item. In mathematical terms, the support of item A is the ratio of transactions involving A to the total number of transactions.</p>
                                <p><strong>Confidence</strong> : Likelihood that customer who bought both A and B. It is the ratio of the number of transactions involving both A and B and the number of transactions involving B.</p>

                                <li><p>Lift (A =&gt; B) = 1 means that there is no correlation within the itemset.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>Lift (A =&gt; B) &gt; 1 means that there is a positive correlation within the itemset, i.e., products in the itemset, A, and B, are more likely to be bought together.</li>
                                <li>Lift (A =&gt; B) &lt; 1 means that there is a negative correlation within the itemset, i.e., products in itemset, A, and B, are unlikely to be bought together.</li>

                                <p><strong>Apriori Algorithm:</strong> Apriori algorithm assumes that any subset of a frequent itemset must be frequent. Its the algorithm behind Market Basket Analysis. Say, a transaction containing {Grapes, Apple, Mango} also contains {Grapes, Mango}. So, according to the principle of Apriori, if {Grapes, Apple, Mango} is frequent, then {Grapes, Mango} must also be frequent.</p>
                                <p>I utilized apriori algorithm from Mlxtend python library and found out associations from top 100 most frequent products which resulted in 28 product pairs (total 56 rules) that have lift highr than 1. The top 10 product pairs having highest lift are shown below:</p>

                                <p>Since the dataframe is huge, I reduced the memory consumption of it by downcasting to fit the data int my memory. I preferred MinMaxScaler over StandardScaler as the latter requires 16 GB of RAM for its operation. I followed standard process for model building and I relied on XGBoost as it handles large data, can be parallelized and gives feature importance. I also built Neural Network to see what would be the best performance from this model disregarding some inherent randomness from both of these models.  To balance the data, I have used cost-sensitive learning by assigning class weightage (~{0:1, 1:10}). I have not used random-upsampling/SMOTE as it would increase the data size and I do not have much memory. Also, since random-down-sampling discards information which might be important and would result in bias. </p>
                                <p>Since, we can hack the F1 score by changing the threshold, I relied on AUC Score for model evaluation. The performance of both of these models is shown below using Confusion Matrix, ROC curve and classification report. The feature important plot from XGBoost model is also shown to understand important features which help predict product&#39;s reorder. The performance of both models is almost similar and XGBoost slightly performs better in terms of ROC-AUC.</p>
